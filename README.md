SpringBoot Uber-APP

This project is a web application designed to simulate an Uber-like ride-hailing platform. A fully functional backend of the Uber application with all industry-grade API endpoints fully developed. It provides features for users to book rides and for drivers to manage their trips. The platform is built using Spring Boot for backend functionality and includes features like ride booking, user management, and fare calculation.

 1.Users can request rides with a payment preference of Wallet or Cash.                                                                                                           
 2.Ride requests are assigned to the nearest drivers or highest-rated drivers nearby, depending on the user's rating.                                                             
 3.Dynamic fare calculation based on distance and surge factor.                                                                                                                 
 4.After completing the ride, users and drivers can rate each other, fostering a feedback-based system.                                                                           
 5.The platform ensures secure user registration and authentication with Spring Security.
